This lab is about writing fast code. We have included 3 types of algorithms for solving the knapsack optimization problem. We have a brute force, a dynamic programming and a greedy approach. We will use this vignette to comment about our results. 

_**Brute force search**_  
  
*How long time does it take to run the brute force algorithm with n=16?*
  
Looping it 1000 times gives the mean time 0.028194.
