\title{Dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a 2dim matrix containing the weights and values}

\item{W}{is the capacity of the knapsack}
}
\value{
a list with the _value_ of the optimally packed knapsack and the _elements_ that gives this value.
}
\description{
Uses DP to find optimal value and elements, i.e. divides the problem into subproblems and solve each one, memoizes it and solve the whole problem by using that
